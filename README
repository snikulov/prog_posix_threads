These are the source files for the programming examples in
"Programming With POSIX(r) Threads". The Makefile is pre-configured
for Digital UNIX, but includes the appropriate definitions to build on
Solaris (uncomment the Solaris lines and comment the Digital UNIX
lines).

Some of these examples have been repaired since the original printing
of the book. Some differ from the examples printed in the latest
printing, as well, because the changes were too large to fit. The
signal-based suspend/resume program, susp.c, has been substantially
revised to correct a number of problems with the original version.

Programs with arguments or special behavior:

alarm, alarm_fork,		The alarm programs will prompt for
alarm_thread, alarm_mutex,	commands until terminated by ^D
alarm_cond			(EOF). Commands are "<n> <s>" where <s>
				(the remainder of the line) is a
				message to print after <n> seconds.
atfork [hang]			Run with an argument of 0 to omit
				atfork handlers -- program will hang.
backoff [backoff [delay]]	Run with first argument of 0, will not
				back off on mutex collision, and will
				usually hang. Second argument can be
				specified greater than 0 to yield
				(increasing chances of hang on
				uniprocessor), or less than 0 to sleep
				for a second.
crew string path		First argument is a search string,
				second is a file path.
flock				Threads will prompt alternately for
				input.
pipe				Prompts for integers to feed to
				pipeline; enter "=" to pop a result.
putchar [unsync]		Run with argument of 0 to concurrently
				call putchar_unlocked from multiple
				threads.
server				Threads each prompt for input, and
				echo it 3 times -- server prevents
				output while waiting for input.
sigwait				Waits for 5 SIGINT signals (^C)
thread				One thread writes to stdout while
				another waits for input from
				stdin. (Satisfy the read to exit.)
